# TunnelGame
A very old game project -- one of my first Javascript games

This thing is old. I made it in college while I was learning Javascript &amp; jQuery, so sometime around 2006 or 2007. There are much better ways to make games nowadays, but someone asked me for the code so I'm putting it online. 

The repo includes code for saving high scores locally with a text file. Having a writable text file on your server that is publicly accessible is very dangerous. I recommend putting this file outside of your public html directory. If you don't know how to make this secure, it's best not to use this feature at all. 

If you end up using this, let me know, I'd love to hear about it -- you can find me on Twitter [@cm0nt0y4](https://twitter.com/cm0nt0y4) or email me: montoya.christian [at] gmail.com
